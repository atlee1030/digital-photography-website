      <p>The history of photography is more extensive than the timeline provided below. However, since this website is about digital photography, it has produced a timeline that focuses on the development of cameras. Based on the development of cameras, it is thought that the historical period of photography can be divided into Early Photography, Film Era, and Digital Era.</p>
      <p>Before the development of portable cameras, the photography method required a lot of human labor. However, from Film Era, when portable cameras began to be invented, it became easier to take pictures if you had knowledge of photography than how to use cameras.</p>
      <p>Then, what is the difference between Film Era and Digital Era? The development of sensors and immediate results can be confirmed. In the past, photography through film could only be viewed through several tasks even after the camera, but after the advent of the Digital Camera, the sensor recognized the phenomenon and then previewed the results through the display. It was an invention that completely compensated for the shortcomings of the Film Camera that relied on one's senses in the past.</p>
      <p>There are many evaluations that the recent development of cameras has reached its limit. However, several large corporations are still trying to make progress, and photographers are looking forward to their invention.</p>
